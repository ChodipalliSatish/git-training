Git Training
============

Welcome.

Does this look familiar?

![xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)

Sadly it's not that far from the truth for many users of Git,
and doesn't always improve with more exposure.

One anology could be made with the following comic.

![](images/elephant.jpg)

In this case each blind man could represent a different Git command.
By just running the commands, there are a number of cases where
what you _think_ Git is doing is not actually what it's actually doing.

In particular this often involves commands relating to branches,
and pushing/pulling from a remote server.

This material is _not_ intended to teach how to "use" Git.
Or at least not for the most part.
The focus of this material is to focus on a few critical
aspects of Git that can often cause the most amount of confusion.
